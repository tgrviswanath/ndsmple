This allows you to share only your source code, hence reducing the size of the shared project vastly.</p><p>The attached course code snippets also are shared in that way, hence you need to run <code>npm install</code> in the extracted packages to be able to run my code!</p><p>I showed that <code>nodemon app.js</code> would <strong>not work</strong> in the terminal or command line because we don't use local dependencies there but global packages.</p><p>You could install <code>nodemon</code> globally if you wanted (this is NOT required though - because we can just run it locally): <code>npm install -g nodemon</code> would do the trick. Specifically the <code>-g</code> flag ensures that the package gets added as a global package which you now can use anywhere on your machine, directly from inside the terminal or command prompt.</p></p>
